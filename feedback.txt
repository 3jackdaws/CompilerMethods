-5 Your git repository has extra files AND the important files were in a subdirectory. The git repository you supply to me must be the actual working directory.

-10 Your build has warnings

-5 Your code does not have ANY useful comments. The only comments were commented out debug code. You must document your code.

-1 DecreaseScope should make sure the list isn't empty prior to the pop

The use of CURRENT_SCOPE macro does not improve the readability of your code. Since you're writing C++ code, you should do this with an inline function instead of a macro.

git is whining about not knowing who you are. Follow the directions it gives you to correct this.

Your git repository contains object files and an executable. It should only have source.

Nice job commenting the code snippets that don't return.
